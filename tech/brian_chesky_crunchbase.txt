Overview:
Brian drives Airbnb&#8217;s vision, strategy and growth. Always pushing the status quo, Brian aims to disrupt the industry with ideas that change the way people live. To grasp the full impact and experience of Airbnb, Brian rid himself of an apartment and has been living in the homes of the Airbnb community since June of 2010. He is committed to assembling a passionate, top tier team to deliver on this promise.

Before Airbnb, Brian ran an industrial design shop in Los Angeles; even these days he is rarely seen without a drafting pen and sketch book in hand. Brian holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in industrial design from the Rhode Island School of Design.

He believes that what sets the company apart is the access to space that would otherwise be off limits, and haunted or not, he would be honored to someday stay in the Lincoln Bedroom through the site.
