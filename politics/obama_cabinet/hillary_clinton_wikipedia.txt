Hillary Diane Rodham was born in Chicago. She was raised in Park Ridge, a suburb located convert15mi northwest of downtown Chicago. Her parents were Hugh E. Rodham and Dorothy Emma Howell Rodham. She is of Welsh, English, French and French Canadian ancestry.cite web author=Roberts, Gary Boyd url=http://www.americanancestors.org/ancestry-of-senator-hillary-rodham-clinton/ title=Notes on the Ancestry of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society accessdate=January 11, 2014HarvnbBernstein2007pp=17–18 Hillary grew up with two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.

She studied at Maine East High School and Maine South High School. She finished high school in 1965, and enrolled at Wellesley College in Massachusetts.

In 1969, Rodham entered Yale Law School. She received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Yale in 1973. Then, she began a year of post-graduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.

== Personal life ==
While working as a faculty member at the Law School of the University of Arkansas, she married Bill Clinton on October 11, 1975. He was also working as a faculty member at the same university. Both knew each other and were classmates at the Yale Law School. Their only child is daughter Chelsea Clinton, born on February 27, 1980.

== First Lady of the United States ==
When she was First Lady, she tried to change the health care system.  Some people did not like it when the planning meetings were kept secret away from the public.  In the end, too many people did not want the changes that she wanted.

Another major event during the time she was First Lady was when the public found out in 1998 that Bill Clinton had a affairsexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky in the mid 1990s. There was stress in the marriage partly because Bill had to go to trial (impeachment) because he was accused of lying to the court (during a deposition).

When she decided that she wanted to be Senator, she chose New York even though she never lived there.  Some accused her of "carpetbagging" because of this.  She went on to win the election and won a second term in 2006.

When the 2003 invasion of Iraqwar between the United States-led coalition and Iraq was about to start, she voted in favor of the war.  Now she is opposed to the war and wants American troops to stop fighting rebel Iraqis.
