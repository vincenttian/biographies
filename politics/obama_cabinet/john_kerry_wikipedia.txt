==Career==
During the 2012 Obama reelection campaign, Kerry participated in one on one debate prep with the president, impersonating the Republican candidate Mitt Romney.cite news url=http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/npr/164617347/likely-suspects-guessing-obama-s-second-term-cabinet

Kerry's vice presidential candidate was John Edwards. The ticket lost the election to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.  One of the reasons Kerry lost is because people said he was an elitist (he did not understand most Americans) and also because a group called "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth" attacked his service in Vietnam.

In November 2006, Kerry once apologizes after saying that college students needed to study hard or else they would "get stuck in Iraq."cite weburl=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/20/us/john-kerry---fast-facts/title=John Kerry Fast Factspublisher=CNN.comaccessdate=2013-07-22
